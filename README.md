# maximum_likelihood_estimation_chongjun_yuchen
An educational app based on BOAST Maximum Likelihood Estimation by Chongjun and Yuchen.  
The source code is from Maximum Likelihood Estimation in BOAST ch5.
# What did we update
## 1. prerequisites
We added explanation of what is the likelihood function and before explaining what ist MLE.  
We explain why the Invariance property and Large Sample Property are necessary in the usage of MLE.
## 2. Explore (plots)
We added the mathematical expressions of optimization of log-likelihood functions for samples from Poisson distribution and exponential distribution.  
We suggest the users to choose a large sample size so the Large Sample Property would apply.  
We removed the two parameters log-likelihood plot since it is a little bit confusing.
